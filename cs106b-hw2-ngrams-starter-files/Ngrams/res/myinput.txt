I plan to research about Business Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility. In the current economy corporations should not only have the responsibility to generate profit for investors but also have to follow certain business ethics and carry out corporate social responsibilities. In my project I will delve into a few issues regarding the implementation. 
Issues about ethical investing: Is ethical investing a sound way to make profit? While ethical investing is the method praised by social mores, it is not necessarily a good way of investing. So does ethical investing fit into the category of good investing strategies?
How many investors in today's market are ethical investors? Because ethical investing sometimes put investors at a certain disadvantage, can ethical investors make more or as much profit as investors who use inside information to benefit themselves?
Do firms try to improve their ethical standards if they are deemed unethical by ethical investors? If there are a substantial number of ethical investors distance themselves from "unethical" firms will those firms make adjustments? Will they change their ethical standards and actions in hope of winning back ethical investors? Or will they continue their unethical practices in the hope of generating more profit, ignoring ethical investors and the general public?
