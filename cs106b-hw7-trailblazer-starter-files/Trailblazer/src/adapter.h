/*
 * CS 106B Trailblazer
 * This file declares code to serve as an "adapter" to convert between various
 * data types used by legacy support code and new code for the current version
 * of this assignment.
 * Specifically, past quarters represented a graph as a Grid<double> and each
 * of its vertices/edges as a Loc (TBLoc) and Edge (TBEdge), while the
 * current version of the assignment represents the graph as a BasicGraph
 * (an extension of Stanford's Graph class) and each vertex/edge as a
 * Vertex / Edge object.
 * This code converts between the two formats to help localize changes made
 * to the assignment starting in 13au by Marty Stepp.
 *
 * Please do not modify this provided file. Your turned-in files should work
 * with an unmodified version of all provided code files.
 *
 * Author: Marty Stepp
 * Version: 2014/03/05 (initial version for 14wi)
